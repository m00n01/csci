	<h1>About Me!</h1>

	<p id="para">My name is Daniel Sanchez and I made this website just for fun.
	I had no real concepts for this, so I instead made this into a autobiography for myself
	Here you will find everything about me. My favorite music, my memorable moments, all of that. All here. I tried making a journal/book, but it didn't much peak my interest, so intead, why not use my computer science skills into making this right? Here is me!</p>
